The wenlan daemon runs entirely on the local machine, with no cloud dependency for core recall.[1] Storage is backed by libSQL with vector search extensions.[2]

## Storage layer

Distilled pages and raw memories share a single database file.[3] The schema versioning strategy follows the upstream design notes.[4]

## Distillation

Pages are compiled from source memories by the pipeline described in [[Memory Distillation]].[5] Authored sections survive re-distillation untouched.[6]

See also [[LibSQL Storage]].

Engagement velocity in the first 30 minutes matters more than raw follower count — a small account with a fast reply burst can outrank a big account's slower engagement. Accounts with a track record of quick, relevant replies get a small ranking boost on their own posts too.

Video and image posts consistently outperform text-only in the For You feed, but only when the caption stays under two sentences; longer captions suppress reach even on identical media.

Quote posts inherit part of the original post's velocity signal, which is why quoting a high-velocity post is a common growth tactic. The feed itself re-ranks every few minutes rather than staying static per session.`,

    content: `# Threads Algorithm Notes (draft)

Early notes from digging into how Threads ranks posts in the For You feed, before I had all the details straight.

Engagement velocity in the first 30 minutes after posting seems to matter a lot more than raw follower count — a post from a small account that gets a burst of replies and reposts right away can outrank a big account's post that got the same total engagement spread over a day. Accounts that reply quickly and relevantly to others build up some kind of reputation signal that carries over and nudges their own posts too, though I don't have a clean way to measure how much yet.

Media matters: photo and video posts consistently do better than text-only posts in the For You feed. Caption length interacts with this though — once you go past roughly two sentences, reach drops noticeably even on the same media, so it is not just "add a photo and you are set."

One growth tactic that keeps coming up: quoting a post that already has high velocity passes along some fraction of its engagement signal to the quote post itself, which is presumably why quote-posting trending content is so common. Still need to check whether this decays with time since the original post.`,

    content: `# Threads Content Anti-Patterns

Posting more than about four times an hour visibly suppresses reach on each post, even when every post performs well on its own. Explicit engagement-bait phrasing ("comment YES if you agree") gets flagged and suppressed rather than boosted.

Reposting the same content within 24 hours reads as spam and tanks both posts. More than two or three hashtags correlates with lower reach — the opposite of old Instagram-era advice. Replying to your own post repeatedly to "bump" it can suppress the original too.`,

    content: `# Threads Posting Mistakes (old)

Older, messier notes on things that seem to hurt reach on Threads — collected before I had a cleaner list.

Engagement-bait phrasing like "comment YES if you agree" or "tag someone who needs this" does not get boosted the way it might on other platforms; it gets flagged and actively suppressed instead, which surprised me at first.

Reposting the exact same content within 24 hours reads as spam to the ranking system and appears to tank the reach of both the original and the repost, not just the newer one. Hashtag stuffing is similarly counterproductive — more than two or three hashtags per post correlates with lower reach, the opposite of the old Instagram-era advice to tag everything.

Replying to your own post multiple times in a row to "bump" it back to the top of followers' feeds reads as spam behavior and can suppress the original post's distribution too.

Two things I have not confirmed yet: whether posting the exact same caption to Threads and Instagram at the same time hurts the Threads post specifically, and whether deleting an underperforming post and immediately reposting it resets its distribution to zero rather than giving it a second look.`,
