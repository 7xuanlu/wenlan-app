// The wizard's runtime row used to store a REAL memory in the maintainer's own
// daemon (store_memory fell through to liveInvoke, which proxied it) and then
// delete it. When this fixture owned every `delete_memory`, that delete was
// swallowed and each preview of the wizard left a real "Wenlan setup check"
// memory behind in the developer's database. store_memory is now synthesized
// in liveInvoke itself (PREVIEW_PROBES — see live-invoke.ts), so it no longer
// touches the daemon at all; this still covers the other half of the fix —
// the fixture may only delete what the fixture itself owns, and every other
// id (a real memory, or the wizard's synthesized probe id) still needs to
// reach delete_memory, which is what actually clears it.
