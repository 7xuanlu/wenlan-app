//! Tauri-owned UI-presence capability minting (M5 App PR, D7).
//!
//! This is a **cooperative local-client provenance boundary**, not hostile
//! same-user isolation — Wenlan's loopback daemon is unauthenticated, and a
//! hostile process running as the same macOS user can read this module's
//! secret because it can read anything that user can read. What this module
//! makes true: a mutation carrying a valid capability came from a concrete
//! user gesture that reached this Tauri backend, an ordinary MCP/HTTP client
//! cannot mint one, and the capability never reaches JavaScript. Binding
//! spec: `docs/plans/2026-07-27-m5-presence-threat-model.md` (in the
//! `wenlan` daemon repo).
//!
//! **Minting, plus the one wire shape a minted capability may take.** The
//! daemon half landed as `POST /api/pages/{id}/review` (daemon PR #418), so
//! the page-review action now has somewhere to go. [`mint_page_review`] mints
//! a capability and renders it as that route's request body in a single call,
//! and [`PresenceCapability`] itself never leaves this module — which is what
//! keeps T1 structural rather than a rule every future call site has to
//! remember. The claim-attest half still has no daemon route, so
//! [`PresenceAction::AttestClaim`] stays mint-only.
