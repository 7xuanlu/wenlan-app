//! The page-review command — the only Tauri command that carries a UI-presence
//! capability.
//!
//! Binding spec: `docs/plans/2026-07-27-m5-presence-threat-model.md` in the
//! `wenlan` daemon repo. Its most load-bearing step is §3.3: **the Tauri
//! backend submits the mutation itself**, so frontend JavaScript never receives
//! a capability. That is why minting and submitting are one command here rather
//! than a `mint` command whose result a second command posts — the intermediate
//! value in that design is a capability sitting in JavaScript, which is a
//! capability sitting anywhere JavaScript reaches (T1).
//!
//! What crosses into JavaScript, in both directions:
//!
//! - in: a page ID and the content the detail view rendered;
//! - out: [`crate::api::PageReviewOutcome`], which carries a version number and
//!   a variant name and nothing else.
//!
//! This module is kept separate from `search.rs`, where the other page commands
//! live, for the same reason the daemon keeps `db/presence_review.rs` separate
//! from its other page routes: the ordering and binding rules only make sense
//! read together, and they are easy to weaken one edit at a time when they are
//! spread through a large file.
